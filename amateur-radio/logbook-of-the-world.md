# Logbook of the World

## What is LoTW?

> Logbook of The World provides a reliable means of validating and confirming QSOs. The system is trusted by over 100,000 radio amateurs from all parts of the globe. Part of the reason that awards such as DXCC remain popular is that they are widely acknowledged as genuine, meaningful achievements. Things are deliberately made tough for cheaters and fraudsters so that honest DXers can continue to trust the awards.

Most operators seem to submit logs through LoTW for logging as their primary source even if they submit through other services at a later date.

Other services: eQSL, QRZ.com, Clublog, Paper QSL Cards.

## Getting Setup

1. Install [TrustedQSL](http://www.arrl.org/tqsl-download) (a.k.a TQSL) - available on Mac, PC, Linux.

    * If you didn't see a prompt, click *Callsign Certificate* at the very top of the window, click *Request New Callsign Certificate...*, and follow the steps.
