# Bender's Digital Garden

🌱 Welcome to my Digital Garden - a place where I can Learn in Public and [Work with the Garage Door Up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). 

## For Visitors

Taken from Shawn Wang's [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/#why-we-need-a-terms-of-service)

Welcome! You are now browsing a [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). This is my personal space for [Learning In Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). I am a lifelong learner so everything is a Work-In-Progress like me, but I do not let perfectionism get in the way. That means that what you read here is not authoritative or complete, and is not representative of my best work. 

However, it is representative of my interests and current state of knowledge, and if you have the same interests, then this space is also yours to use as a reference. Feedback and social sharing is welcome - that is the whole point of being public!

### 1. Right to Be Wrong

I have a right to be wrong or incomplete in my Digital Garden, either due to paucity of time or knowledge. You will not hold this, or my readership, against me because I will keep learning, with your help. Everything in the Digital Garden is a living document and I will retract or rephrase things I no longer agree with.

### 2. Constructive Criticism

You are expressly welcome to comment on, tear apart, counter-argue, or outright disagree on anything here. No compliment sandwich needed - I learn most from critics. I will listen to you but I don't promise to agree with you. Please also suggest what else I should include, read, watch, or listen to, or tell me what you would have written instead. 

Better yet, write a better version of what I did and publish it on your own Garden. I'd love to read it.

### 3. Attribute, don't Plagiarize

Don't plagiarize. You're welcome to quote, with attribution and a link back here. I don't waive copyright for commercial purposes. But feel free to share ideas and riff off of them.

## How I Organize

### Note Type

**Seeds** are brand new notes that I haven't fully fleshed out yet. These might include some kind of basic thought I felt I needed to jot down, a quote I liked and want to journal on later, or something else. 

**Sprouts** are notes that I've written a little bit of detail on, and can serve as a good reference for later info. With a little bit of polishing and watering, these notes can quickly become trees.

**Trees** are blog-post worthy notes, either they have been posted or I'm planning on posting it at some point. If I have blogged about it, you can find it at [ko4jzt.tech](https://ko4jzt.tech).
